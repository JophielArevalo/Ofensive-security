This repository contains my Offensive Cyber Security / Penetration Testing work, including multi‑host exploitation labs, full Active Directory compromise, and hands‑on offensive tooling.
Included Projects

- Active Directory Full Compromise

LDAP enumeration, AS‑REP roasting, Kerberoast hash cracking, BloodHound attack‑path mapping, GenericAll privilege escalation, DCSync, and final Domain Admin takeover using Evil‑WinRM.

- Multi‑Host Pentest (14 Flags)
  
EternalBlue exploitation, SQL injection, CMS exploitation (WolfCMS), proxy abuse, steganography, custom reverse shells, privilege escalation on Linux/Windows hosts.

Skills Demonstrated

- Network enumeration (Nmap, NetExec, SMB)
- Web exploitation (SQLi, file upload bypass, reverse shell injection)
- AD attacks (Kerberoast, AS‑REP Roast, DCSync)
- Privilege escalation (Linux/Windows)
- Binary unpacking (UPX)
- Reverse shell development
-Lateral movement & multi‑host strategy

This repo demonstrates offensive technical depth aligned with junior penetration testers, red‑team operators, and offensive security roles.
